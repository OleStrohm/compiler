Tokenizer:
    Tokenize incoming data and annotate tokens
        Feed tokens forward to CFG and AST

CFG:
    Use proper operators
        Merge assignment and binary operators
    Create unary operators
    Substitute id and num back to the corresponding values

AST:
    Atom
        Use id and num as inputs to 'literal',
         and child node as value
    Make grammar (partially) responsible for which indexes are used
     as children to the node (maybe also compilation rules)
